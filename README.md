# integration_rules_NA
**This is a Numerical Analysis assignment (ECE AUTH 4th semester)**  
Integrate a function with different intagration rules and plot the error.
You can also compute and plot the max error of the integration rules, but only for the function given in the assigmnent: e^3x*sin(2x), xΕ[0, π/4]
